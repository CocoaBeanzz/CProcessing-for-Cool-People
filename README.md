# CProcessing for Cool People

CProcessing for Cool People ("CPfCP") is a fork of DigiPen's CProcessing wrapper for the Processing graphical library and FMOD audio engine in C focused on deeper integration of FMOD's advanced features as well as some general quality-of-life improvements. The main goal of CProcessing for Cool People is to maximize accesibility of FMOD's real-time digital sample processing for entry-level users with a convenient package to drop into any C-based project. 

## Added Features:
- FMOD DSP Integration with simplified parameter control. 

## Improvements:
- Added function block comments to all library functions of CP_Sound.c, taken directly from the CProcessing documentation whenever possible.

## Planned Features:
- Add function block comments to all CProcessing library functions.
- Fix discrepancy between parameter types in CProcessing graphics functions. 
- \[More TBD]
