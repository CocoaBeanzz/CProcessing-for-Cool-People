# CProcessing for Cool People

CProcessing for Cool People is a fork of DigiPen's CProcessing framework for Processing and FMOD compatibility with C focused on deeper integration of FMOD's advanced features as well as some general quality-of-life improvements. The main goal of CProcessing for Cool People is to maximize accesibility of FMOD's real-time audio processing for entry-level users with a convenient package to drop into any C-based project.
